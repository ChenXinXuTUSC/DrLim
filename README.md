# DrLim with some comparison

The base model is from [Dimensionality Reduction by Learning an Invariant Mapping CVPR2006](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1640964). Implementation is from [heekhero](https://github.com/heekhero/DrLIM). This repo uses Fashion-Mnist, Cifra-10 and Cifar-100 to test the performance of DrLim. As the paper propose the contrastive loss, it is also compared with triplet loss proposed in [FaceNet CVPR2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832)
